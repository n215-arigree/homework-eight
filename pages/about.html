        <h3>Our CEO - Bob Doofenshmirtz</h3>
        <p>
          Bob is a real human who enjoys playing tennis and investing in the
          stock market. Bob has liked candy since he was a child and created
          Candy Shop when he was 11. Bob started the company in his parent's
          garage originally selling candy to friends, neighbors, and dogs. Bob
          secretly doesn't like candy anymore. But his favorite is gummy worms.
